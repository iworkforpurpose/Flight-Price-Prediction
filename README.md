1. Overview

This project involves several steps:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing raw flight data.
Feature Engineering: Extracting relevant features from the dataset to improve prediction accuracy.
Model Training: Evaluating multiple machine learning algorithms to predict flight prices.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of each model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Prediction: Deploying the best performing model to predict future flight prices.

2. Features

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and outliers.
Feature Extraction: Creating new features from date, time, and categorical variables.
Model Comparison: Training and evaluating different models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
Visualization: Graphical representation of data distributions and model performance.
Prediction Interface: Command-line based interface for inputting parameters and receiving price predictions.

4. Usage

Prepare your data:
Place your dataset (e.g., flights.csv) in the designated data folder or update the file path in the configuration.

Run the main script:

css
Copy
Edit
python main.py
This script will handle data preprocessing, model training, and generating predictions.

Optional arguments:
You can add command-line arguments to adjust parameters such as data paths, model type, or evaluation metrics. For help, run:

Copy
Edit
python main.py --help

5. Data

Dataset Description:
Briefly describe your dataset (e.g., source, number of records, key features).

Data Preprocessing:
Outline how the raw data is transformed (e.g., handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, normalization).

6. Modeling

Algorithms:
Describe the machine learning models implemented (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest).

Training Process:
Explain the model training process including data splitting (train/test), cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning.

Evaluation Metrics:
List the metrics used to assess model performance (e.g., MAE, MSE, RMSE).

7. Results

Model Performance:
Summarize the performance of the different models.

Visualizations:
Mention any plots or charts used to illustrate model performance (e.g., prediction vs. actual price graphs, feature importance charts).
